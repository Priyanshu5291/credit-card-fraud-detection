Credit Card Fraud Detection
Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of efficiently detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are fraudulent. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, specialized techniques are necessary to build a reliable and effective model.
Business Problem Overview
For banks and financial institutions, retaining high-value customers is a key business priority. However, the rise in credit card fraud poses significant risks, leading to substantial financial losses and erosion of customer trust.
According to a Nilson Report, global losses from card fraud were projected to reach $30 billion by 2020. As digital payment channels grow, fraudsters are continually evolving their methods, making robust fraud detection systems essential.
Machine learning enables banks to automate fraud detection, reduce manual review efforts, prevent costly chargebacks, and safeguard legitimate customer transactions.
Understanding and Defining Fraud
Credit card fraud refers to unauthorized transactions made using stolen or counterfeit cards or card information. Common types of credit card fraud include:
•	Skimming: Duplication of information from a card’s magnetic stripe.
•	Manipulation or alteration of genuine cards.
•	Creation of counterfeit cards.
•	Unauthorized use of stolen or lost cards.
•	Fraudulent telemarketing activities.
Data Dictionary
The dataset can be accessed here.
Key details about the dataset:
•	Transactions are recorded over two days in September 2013 by European cardholders.
•	Out of 284,807 transactions, 492 are labeled as fraudulent (approximately 0.172%).
•	Features:
o	Time: Seconds elapsed between the first transaction and subsequent transactions.
o	Amount: Transaction amount.
o	Class: Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate).
o	V1 to V28: Principal components obtained via PCA to ensure confidentiality.
Additional features include transaction amounts, merchant details, and timestamps.
Project Goals
•	Develop a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high efficiency.
•	Address class imbalance using oversampling (e.g., SMOTE), undersampling, or synthetic data generation techniques.
•	Engineer meaningful features such as transaction frequency, location mismatch, and unusual spending patterns.
•	Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC, rather than relying solely on accuracy.
•	Expected Outcome: A fraud detection model that minimizes false positives while maintaining high fraud detection accuracy.
Project Pipeline
The project workflow consists of the following steps:
•	Data Understanding: Load and explore the dataset, understand feature distributions, and identify potential improvements through feature engineering.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform univariate and bivariate analyses. Investigate data distributions, identify skewness, and engineer new features that could capture anomalous behavior.
•	Handling Class Imbalance: Apply techniques such as oversampling (e.g., SMOTE), undersampling, or hybrid approaches to balance the dataset effectively.
•	Train/Test Split: Perform a stratified train-test split to ensure proportional representation of fraudulent transactions. Utilize cross-validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) for model validation.
•	Model Building and Hyperparameter Tuning: Train multiple machine learning models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and select the model that offers the best trade-off between fraud detection and minimizing false positives.
•	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using precision, recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrix analysis. Focus on minimizing false positives without sacrificing fraud detection capability.
